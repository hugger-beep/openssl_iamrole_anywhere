# IAM Roles Anywhere - Complete OpenSSL Certificate Setup Script
# Run in AWS CloudShell or Linux environment

### **üöÄ QUICK START: How to Run in AWS CloudShell**
# 1. Open AWS CloudShell: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/
# 2. Upload this script: Click "Actions" > "Upload file" > Select openssl.sh
# 3. Make executable: chmod +x openssl.sh
# 4. Run script: ./openssl.sh
# 5. Download certificates: Click "Actions" > "Download file" > Select files from iam-roles-anywhere-certs/
#
# üìù **CloudShell Commands:**
# wget https://your-domain.com/openssl.sh  # If hosted online
# chmod +x openssl.sh
# ./openssl.sh
# ls -la iam-roles-anywhere-certs/  # View generated files

### **ENGINEER NOTE: WHERE TO RUN THIS SCRIPT**
# üåê **RECOMMENDED: AWS CloudShell**
#   - Pre-installed OpenSSL and AWS CLI
#   - No Windows path conversion issues
#   - Direct access to AWS services
#   - Secure environment for certificate generation
#   - Easy file upload/download via web interface
#
# üíª **ALTERNATIVE: Linux/macOS Terminal**
#   - Requires OpenSSL and AWS CLI installation
#   - Native bash environment
#
# ‚ùå **NOT RECOMMENDED: Windows Git Bash**
#   - Path conversion issues (MSYS_NO_PATHCONV needed)
#   - Potential OpenSSL compatibility issues
#
# üìÅ **EXECUTION LOCATION:**
# Run from any directory - script creates 'iam-roles-anywhere-certs' subdirectory
# All certificates will be generated in: ./iam-roles-anywhere-certs/

### **ENGINEER NOTE: Script Purpose**
# This script creates a complete Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for IAM Roles Anywhere
# using OpenSSL as an External Trust Anchor. It generates:
# 1. Certificate Authority (CA) - The root of trust
# 2. Client Certificate - For user authentication
# 3. Application Certificate - For application authentication
# All certificates are properly signed and include correct X.509 extensions

set -e  # Exit on any error

### **ENGINEER NOTE: Certificate Subject Configuration**
# X.509 Distinguished Names follow the format: /C=Country/ST=State/L=Locality/O=Organization/OU=OrganizationalUnit/CN=CommonName
# CN (Common Name) is the most important field - it identifies the certificate holder
# These subjects can be customized for your organization

# The inline config defines proper CA extensions:
#   - basicConstraints = CA:TRUE: Marks this as a Certificate Authority
#   - keyUsage = keyCertSign, cRLSign: Allows signing certificates and CRLs
#   - subjectKeyIdentifier: Unique identifier for this CA

# 1. Create Trust Anchor (upload CA certificate)

### **ENGINEER NOTE: PKI Security Model**
# This script implements a standard PKI hierarchy:
# 
# Root CA (ca.pem + ca.key)
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client Certificate (client.pem + client.key)
#   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Application Certificate (app.pem + app.key)
#
# Security Principles:
# 1. CA private key (ca.key) is the "root of trust" - compromise = total PKI compromise
# 2. Client private keys provide AWS access - treat like AWS access keys
# 3. CA certificate (ca.pem) is public - can be shared freely
# 4. Certificate chain validation ensures authenticity
# 5. X.509 extensions enforce proper certificate usage
#
# IAM Roles Anywhere Trust Model:
# 1. AWS trusts your CA certificate (uploaded as Trust Anchor)
# 2. Any certificate signed by your CA is trusted by AWS
# 3. Certificate subject (CN) can be used for access control
# 4. IAM roles determine actual AWS permissions
